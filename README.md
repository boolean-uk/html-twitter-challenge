# Twitter Clone

In this project, I created a Twitter clone to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS, achieving a high level of detail in replicating the Twitter interface. The project showcased my skills in using HTML elements for content structuring, an external CSS stylesheet for styling, CSS Grid for layout design, and responsiveness for cross-device compatibility

I have deployed the repo on vercel and it is available to view a live demo. I would really appreciate if you viewed the work I am so proud of and see it in action. <a href="https://twitter-clone-96xtyzyzc-mannavic.vercel.app/">Link to deployed app<a/>

## Setup
1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine
3. Open a Pull Request back to the upstream repo

## Instructions
- Use the HTML elements you've learned about so far to define the page content
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style the page
- Use CSS Grid for the layout and components
- You should start *without* images and then add them later at the end of the exercise once the basic criteria has been met

### Tips
- Breakdown the page into sections
- Pay attention to alignment and spacing
- Work section by section until it looks good

## Assesment Criteria
* &#9745; Layout the main page elements (left-hand menu, tweet feed and right side-bar) using CSS Grid. CSS Grid should also be used to layout individual tweets.
* &#9745; Define the page contents using HTML with appropriate elements. HTML should be well formatted.
* &#9745; Style the page using a mixture of Type, ID and Class CSS selector types
* &#9745; Implement hover and selected state for the left-hand menu links.

### Extension Criteria
* &#9745; Make the layout responsive so that the side-bars are removed on lower resolution devices
* &#9745; Include images using the `img` and `svg` tags.
    * Get the source for the icon images from the Twitter website as SVG and include them with `svg` tags
    * Use a local file for the profile image. Research how to use CSS to to make the profile image appear as a circle
