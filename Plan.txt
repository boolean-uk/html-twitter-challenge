TWITTER CHALLENGE 

ISTRUCTION

- Use the HTML elements you've learned about so far to define the page content
- Use an external CSS stylesheet to style the page
- Use CSS Grid for the layout and components
- You should start without images and then add them later at the end of the exercise once the basic criteria has been met

TIPS

- Breakdown the page into sections
- Pay attention to alignment and spacing
- Work section by section until it looks good

CORE

☑ Layout the main page elements (left-hand menu, tweet feed and right side-bar) using CSS Grid. CSS Grid should also be used to layout individual tweets. ✅
☑ Define the page contents using HTML with appropriate elements. HTML should be well formatted. ✅
☑ Style the page using a mixture of Type, ID and Class CSS selector types. ✅
☑ Implement hover and selected state for the left-hand menu link. 


PLAN

1 - Create a grid with 3 columns. ✅

- Column 1: Left Bar
Create a grid inside with 11 rows. ✅
The first row needs to have just the 'twitter' icon.✅
8 rows will have inside 2 columns. 1 for the icon 1 for the 'description'.✅
Then there's the 'button'.✅
At the end of the columns I need a row (last one) which will contain a 'profile image, name/username and ... for settings'. (See Discord for reference).✅

- Column 2: Main Feed
# I'll need at least 3 rows.
First row will be for text input with 5 icons and a 'button' to 'pubblish the post'(i.e. Linkedin).✅
Second part will be the 'feed'. ✅

- Column 3: Right Bar
3 rows grid.
First one wil be 'home' with 'star icon' and search bar.
The second one will be for 'News'.
Third 'who to follow'
